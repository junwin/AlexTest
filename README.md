# AlexTest
Simple test grid - essentially a repo where I play with Angular 1
There is a simple bar chart added.

Its best to clone the repo in some folder where you keep your code projects
git clone https://github.com/junwin/AlexTest.git

Install
You need to have NPM installed - see https://www.npmjs.com/
Then run these commands:

npm install
npm install angular-ui-grid
npm install angular-chart.js --save
npm install chart.js --save

Debuggging in Chrome using Visual Code
You need to install the Chrome debugger from within Visual Studio Code
* Ctrl+Shift + P to open command palatte
* ext install
* Install Debugger for Chrome - note you will probably need to restart visula studio code

Running  
npm run lite

Typically the lite server will host your site as http://localhost:3000/
